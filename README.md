# LogIt
Hey there! This is our Android application, LogIt, for Orbital 2019 Summer Project (CP2106: Independent Software Development Project).

<img src ="Images%20for%20Github/Poster.jpg" width="850">

**LogIt** is designed to help the user, primarily busy demographics, **to better manage their daily life by recording down their daily to-dos, events, and thoughts.** The application is also **integrated with other relevant productivity tools**, such as the **Eisenhower Matrix**, to further assist the user to manage their daily life more efficiently.

## Features
### Sign up & LogIn

</p>

Upon signing up, a verification email will be sent to the entered email address. The user will have to verify their account first before they can log into LogIt. After logging in, the current user will stay logged in each time they open the app until they choose to log out.

### Daily Log
<p>

  <img src="Images%20for%20Github/Daily%20log%202.jpg" width="200" height="350"/> 
</p>

The Daily Log of today is the first page the user sees upon logging in/starting up as a logged in user, and one they will frequently return to. **Notes, Tasks and Events** for the day can be viewed here (the page is scrollable when number of items exceeds page limits). The user can either **swipe left or right or click on the respective tabs** to view the desired type of entry. This page can  be returned to anytime via the “Today” option in the side drawer or by selecting its date in the Calendar page (next section).

### Calendar
<p>

  <img src="Images%20for%20Github/Calendar%202.jpg" width="200" height="350"/> 
  <img src="Images%20for%20Github/Calendar%203.jpg" width="200" height="350"/> 
  <img src="Images%20for%20Github/Calendar%204.jpg" width="200" height="350"/> 
</p>

The Calendar page can be accessed from the “Calendar” option in the side drawer. **Selecting any day opens the Daily Log page of that day**. You can also **fill up the year, month, and day fields** below the calendar and click on **“Go To Day”** to go to the Daily Log of the desired day.

### Monthly Log
<p>
  <img src="Images%20for%20Github/Monthly%20log%201.jpg" width="200" height="350"/>
  <img src="Images%20for%20Github/Monthly%20log%202.jpg" width="200" height="350"/> 
  <img src="Images%20for%20Github/Monthly%20log%203.jpg" width="200" height="350"/> 
  <img src="Images%20for%20Github/Monthly%20log%204.jpg" width="200" height="350"/> 
</p>

The Monthly Log is an overview of sorts for the **most important items in a month chosen by the user to be included** in **(migrated to)** the list (see Entry Form section). **The current month’s Monthly Log** can be accessed through the **“This Month”** option in the side drawer. If you want to navigate to **other Monthly Logs**, fill up the year, **select the desired month** and click on **“Go To Month”**.

### Collection Log
<p>
  <img src="Images%20for%20Github/Collection%20log%201.png" width="200" height="350"/>
  <img src="Images%20for%20Github/Collection%20log%202.png" width="200" height="350"/> 
  <img src="Images%20for%20Github/Collection%20log%203.png" width="200" height="350"/> 
  <img src="Images%20for%20Github/Collection%20log%204.png" width="200" height="350"/> 
</p>

Users can also group their journal entries under a collection and view them through the Collection Log. **To create a new collection**, the user can either click on the **“New Collection”** option in the navigation drawer or simply **type a new collection in the collection field** in the journal entry form. **To view the collection log**, click on **“Collection”** in the navigation drawer and then click on the collection you want in the collections list to show its collection log.

### Eisenhower Matrix
<p>
  <img src="Images%20for%20Github/Eisenhower%201.png" width="200" height="350"/>
  <img src="Images%20for%20Github/Eisenhower%202.png" width="200" height="350"/> 
  <img src="Images%20for%20Github/Eisenhower%203.png" width="200" height="350"/> 
  <img src="Images%20for%20Github/Eisenhower%204.png" width="200" height="350"/> 
  <img src="Images%20for%20Github/Eisenhower%205.png" width="200" height="350"/> 
</p>

The Eisenhower Matrix serves as a tool to help the user prioritise tasks. Upon clicking the priority field in the entry form, a dialog will pop out. The dialog has two drop-down lists, which are importance and urgency. It is designed to help the user to determine which category their tasks should belong to. After selecting the priority and adding the task entry, the user can then view their task entries in the respective Eisenhower category (“Do, Decide, Delegate, Eliminate”) by clicking on the **“Eisenhower Matrix”** option in the side drawer and selecting the respective Eisenhower category. 

### Viewing a list of Entries
<p>
  <img src="Images%20for%20Github/View%20entries%201.jpg" width="200" height="350"/>
  <img src="Images%20for%20Github/View%20entries%202.jpg" width="200" height="350"/> 
  <img src="Images%20for%20Github/View%20entries%203.jpg" width="200" height="350"/> 
</p>

A list of all Entries of one type can be viewed by **clicking on the corresponding Entries’ buttons** at the bottom of most pages, or the **“All Entries Of This Type”** button in the Entry details page (refer Viewing an Entry section).

### Adding a new Entry or Editing an existing Entry
<p>
  <img src="Images%20for%20Github/Add%20entry%201.png" width="200" height="350"/>
  <img src="Images%20for%20Github/Add%20entry%202.png" width="200" height="350"/> 
  <img src="Images%20for%20Github/Add%20entry%203.png" width="200" height="350"/> 
</p>

**Clicking on the “plus sign” icon** in an Entry list leads to a (scrollable) form for entering the details of the Entry to be added.As before, Tasks have an extra selection for Eisenhower tags and Events have an extra location field. User can choose to add an entry into the Monthly Log **(migration)** by selecting the “Add to Monthly Log” checkbox. The **Collections field is optional**, Entries are not required to be grouped in a Collection. Clicking on the Edit Button when viewing Entries opens up a form filled with the current details.

### Viewing an Entry
<p>
  <img src="Images%20for%20Github/View%20entry%201.jpg" width="200" height="350"/>
  <img src="Images%20for%20Github/View%20entry%202.jpg" width="200" height="350"/>

  <img src="Images%20for%20Github/View%20entry%204.jpg" width="200" height="350"/> 
</p>

Clicking on an item in any of the Logs or lists brings up all the details of the Entry. Certain types of entries may have extra fields. **Tasks** have an **Eisenhower field** that corresponds to its category in the Eisenhower Matrix, and **Events** have a **Location** field. All fields are horizontally scrollable in case content exceeds container limits. The **Edit** Button opens a form to edit details of an entry (previous section), and the **Delete** Button deletes the entry (with confirmation dialog, rightmost pic).

### Search function
<p>
  <img src="Images%20for%20Github/Search%201.jpg" width="200" height="350"/>

  <img src="Images%20for%20Github/Search%204.png" width="200" height="350"/> 
</p>

Clicking on the **“Search” icon** on the top bar opens a Search bar where the user can search for Entries that contain their search query (case-insensitive) in the title or description. There are suggestions for recent searches which can be cleared by selecting the **“Clear Search History”** option on the top right.

**\*All pages work in landscape orientation as well as portrait**

## Methods Employed to Test the Application
### Self Evaluation
We have tested the app on real Android phones. We tried to use the functionalities in different ways and combinations to ensure that the app works as intended and does not crash. Tests include continuously orientating the phone while using chains of functionalities, performing CRUD operations on Daily Log, Monthly Log, Collection Log, and Eisenhower Matrix, accessing each page from a variety of preceding pages and testing where the app lands when clicking the phone’s back button, as well as changing the time of Entries to test whether they are still sorted properly in chronological order.
